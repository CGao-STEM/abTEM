However, since the nucleus and core electrons constitute most of the charge in an atom, this is often a good approximation, which gets progressively better as the atomic number increases. Nonetheless, due to recent improvements in microscopes, interest in going beyond this approximation have started. For example, it has been shown that simulated images based on potentials from DFT calculations can provide a better match with experimental data for light elements. In a later tutorial, we go beyond the IAM using density functional theory.\n",

This method can be used in abTEM by setting `method = 'infinite'` when instantiating the potential. By default, abTEM uses the slower but more accurate finite potential projection.
