    "The independent atom model (IAM) neglects any effects due to bonding and charge transfer. However, since the nucleus and core electrons constitute most of the charge in an atom, this is often a good approximation. Nonetheless, the difference between the IAM and a more realistic model including the effects of bonding is measurable, at least in certain systems. This difference can obviously be important, since it contains all the chemistry of the system.\n",
