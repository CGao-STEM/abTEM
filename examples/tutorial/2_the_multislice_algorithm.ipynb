The electron charge distribution of an atom can be calculated from a first-principles electronic structure calculation, while the atomic nuclei are a point charges at the resolution of a TEM. Given a charge distribution, the potential can be obtained via Poisson's equation. \n",

However, since the nucleus and core electrons constitute most of the charge in an atom, this is often reasonable approximation, which gets progressively better as the atomic number increases. Nonetheless, due to recent improvements in microscopes, interest in going beyond this approximation have started. For example, it has been shown that simulated images based on potentials from DFT calculations can provide a better match with experimental data for light elements. This will be investigated later in this tutorial.\n",
