Here we create a nanoparticle of gold in the FCC crystal structure, by specifying 6 layers in the (100) directions, 9 in the (110) directions and 5 in the (111) directions. The nanoparticle is first rotated into the (110) zone-axis, then it is rotated such that a (111) plane aligns with the $y$-axis. This is a commonly imaged direction for gold nanoparticles."
